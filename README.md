# tipakBot-legacy

This is an old repository i wanted to have my bot in, however since for a good while i didn't actually do it, i decided to create completely different repository for purpose of rewriting. This is mainly because i wanted it to be a TypeScript project, which should give me enough perspective on it to have any way to back up or change my claims i so far made about it.

The new repository is located [here](https://github.com/tipakA/tipakBot).
